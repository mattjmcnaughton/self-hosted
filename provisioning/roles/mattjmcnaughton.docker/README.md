# mattjmcnaughton.docker

Role for installing Docker on a host.

Long term, we might try and swap out Docker for containerd or cri-o... but
probably not.

## Disclaimer

We've copy/paste this role from `nuage`. In the medium term, we should
re-combine both roles and pull both from ansible galaxy or github.
